## 4.2.0

Released on ??

- **Active mode**
  - suppaftp now supports Active-mode (credit [@devbydav](https://github.com/devbydav))
  - You can change mode with `set_mode(Mode::Passive) or set_mode(Mode::Active)` whenever you want
- **New commands**
  - **Abort command**: implemented the `ABOR` FTP command
  - **Append command**: implemented the `APPE` FTP command
  - **Resume transfer command**: implemented the `REST` FTP command
- **Logging**: `log` crate has been implemented for debugging. You can disable logging with `no-log` feature
- Security
  - **TlsStream shutdown**: fixed [issue 5](https://github.com/veeso/suppaftp/issues/5) (credit [@devbydav](https://github.com/devbydav))
- ‚ùó Breaking changes:
  - `Response.code` renamed to `status`.
  - status is no more a `u32`: from now on it will be an enum named `Status`.
    - The status enum implements the `code()` method which will return the `u32` representation
    - The status enum can be displayed and converted to string: this will return the description of the error code
  - Changed `into_insecure()` to `clear_command_channel()`: the implementation of into_insecure was wrong and inconsistent. What it actually does is to make the server not to encrypt the communication on the command channel.

Released on 01/12/2021

  - Fixed file parsing, which didn't allow any other characters than alphanumerics for groups, users and dates
