## 5.0.0

Released on 24/02/2023

- [Issue 33](https://github.com/veeso/suppaftp/issues/33) **‼️ BREAKING CHANGES ‼️**
  - Features are now additive. This means that you can successfully build suppaftp with all the features enabled at the same time.
  - Ftp stream has now been split into different types:
    - `FtpStream`: sync no-tls stream
    - `NativeTlsFtpStream`: ftp stream with TLS with native-tls
    - `RustlsFtpStream`: ftp stream with TLS with rustls
    - `AsyncFtpStream`: async no-tls stream
    - `AsyncNativeTlsFtpStream`: async ftp stream with TLS with async-native-tls
    - `AsyncRustlsFtpStream`: async ftp stream with TLS with async-rustls

## 4.7.0

Released on 01/02/2023

- [RFC 2428](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2428) implementation
  - [Issue 28](https://github.com/veeso/suppaftp/issues/28): Implemented Extended Passive mode (**EPSV**)
  - [Issue 30](https://github.com/veeso/suppaftp/issues/30): Implemented EPRT
- Updated suppaftp-cli to suppaftp 4.7.0

## 4.6.1

Released on 26/01/2023

- `suppaftp::list::File` now derives the `core::hash::Hash` trait

## 4.6.0

Released on 09/01/2023

- `MDTM` now returns `NaiveDateTime` since the command won't provide timezone

## 4.5.3

Released on 27/12/2022

- Don't use read to string from stream, but read line
- Response body is now bytes
- Fixed [issue 24](https://github.com/veeso/suppaftp/issues/24)

## 4.5.2

Released on 10/10/2022

- Fixed missing export of tls stream

## 4.5.1

Released on 08/10/2022

- Export `TlsStream` when async secure

## 4.5.0

Released on 08/10/2022

- Added `native-tls-vendored` and `async-native-tls-vendored` features to link OpenSSL statically
- suppaftp-cli as a separate package.
- Rustls support
- **‼️ BREAKING CHANGE**: refactored secure features:
  - **REMOVED** `secure`/`async-secure` feature
  - Use `native-tls` to enable TLS support with native-tls crate
  - Use `async-native-tls` to enable async TLS support with async-native-tls crate
  - Use `rustls` to enable TLS support with rustls crate
  - Use `async-rustls` to enable TLS support with async-tls crate

## 4.4.0

Released on 02/08/2022

- Added `set_passive_nat_workaround()` method to allow PASV with server behind NAT/proxy

## 4.3.0

Released on 27/06/2022

- Added implicit FTPS support
  - Added `connect_secure_implicit()` method
  - Added `deprecated` feature to enable deprecated methods (required for implicit FTPS)

## 4.2.0

Released on 07/12/2021

- **Active mode**
  - suppaftp now supports Active-mode (credit [@devbydav](https://github.com/devbydav))
  - You can change mode with `set_mode(Mode::Passive) or set_mode(Mode::Active)` whenever you want
- **New commands**
  - **Abort command**: implemented the `ABOR` FTP command
  - **Append command**: implemented the `APPE` FTP command
  - **Resume transfer command**: implemented the `REST` FTP command
- **Logging**: `log` crate has been implemented for debugging. You can disable logging with `no-log` feature
- Security
  - **TlsStream shutdown**: fixed [issue 5](https://github.com/veeso/suppaftp/issues/5) (credit [@devbydav](https://github.com/devbydav))
- ❗ Breaking changes:
  - `Response.code` renamed to `status`.
  - status is no more a `u32`: from now on it will be an enum named `Status`.
    - The status enum implements the `code()` method which will return the `u32` representation
    - The status enum can be displayed and converted to string: this will return the description of the error code
  - Changed `into_insecure()` to `clear_command_channel()`: the implementation of into_insecure was wrong and inconsistent. What it actually does is to make the server not to encrypt the communication on the command channel.
  - Removed `File::from_line`; use `File::try_from()` or `File::from_str()`

## 4.1.3

Released on 01/12/2021

- UNIX file parser:
  - Fixed file parsing, which didn't allow any other characters than alphanumerics for groups, users and dates
- `put_file()` will now return the amount of bytes written
- Updated dependencies

## 4.1.2

Released on 23/08/2021

- Renamed `InvalidResponse` to `UnexpectedResponse`, which makes more sense
- Renamed `File::from_unix_line` to `File::from_posix_line`
- Renamed `UnixPexQuery` to `PosixPexQuery`
- Made `parse_dostime` private

## 4.1.1

Released on 22/08/2021

- Fixed missing `cli/` directory on Cargo registry.

## 4.1.0

Released on 22/08/2021

- Added `Response` struct, which will be returned in case of `InvalidResponse` error.
  - This adds the possibility to get the exact error code and the message
- Added **async** support
- **API** changes
  - renamed `simple_retr` to `retr_as_buffer`
  - renamed `get` to `retr_as_stream`
  - renamed `finalize_get_stream` to `finalize_retr_stream`

  - Read more on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/suppaftp/4.1.0/suppaftp/list/index.html)
- Optimized code to reuse stream functions as much as possible
